# fix-subtitles
This is a Perl script to fix srt subtitles

Basically, I found an srt format subtitles file which were taken from a DVD rip of a TV show - dialogue in the version of the show on YouTube started 12 seconds earlier, so this script currently takes 12 seconds off.

To Do:
Add parameters for input file, output file and number of seconds...
